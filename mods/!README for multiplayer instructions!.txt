Some of the mods in this list are client-only mods. Many of them are designed to just
automatically disable themselves if they detect they are being loaded in a server
environment. However, a few of them will crash the game if loaded on a server.

To play this pack on a server, make sure to DELETE the following mods:
- Lightly
- NoFog
- Oculus
- TagTooltips
